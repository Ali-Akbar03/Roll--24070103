"The explanations for all 15 codes are in the PDF file attached firsthe explanations for all 15 codes are in the PDF file attached first."

Here are brief explanations for each of the Java programs you mentioned:

1. **Print a 2D Array**: A program to print all the elements of a given 2D array, iterating through the rows and columns using nested loops.

2. **Sum of Elements**: This program calculates the sum of all elements in a 2D array by iterating through each element and accumulating the total sum.

3. **Find Maximum and Minimum**: This program finds the largest and smallest elements in a 2D array by iterating over all elements and comparing them.

4. **Row-wise and Column-wise Sum**: This program calculates the sum of elements in each row and each column separately by iterating through the 2D array.

5. **Transpose of a Matrix**: This program computes the transpose of a matrix, where rows are converted into columns and vice versa.

### Intermediate Level:

6. **Matrix Addition**: A program that adds two matrices of the same size and stores the result in a third matrix by adding corresponding elements.

7. **Matrix Multiplication**: This program multiplies two matrices by following the matrix multiplication rule (sum of products of rows and columns) and stores the result in a new matrix.

8. **Search an Element in 2D Array**: This program searches for a specified element in a 2D array and prints the position (row and column) where itâ€™s found.

9. **Check Symmetric Matrix**: A program to check if a matrix is symmetric, meaning it is equal to its transpose (matrix[i][j] == matrix[j][i] for all i, j).

10. **Diagonal Sum**: This program calculates the sum of the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) and secondary diagonal (top-right to bottom-left) elements of a square matrix.

### Advanced Level:

11. **Spiral Order Printing**: A program to print elements of a 2D array in spiral order (starting from the top-left corner and working inwards, covering all elements).

12. **Rotate Matrix by 90 Degrees**: This program rotates a square matrix by 90 degrees in a clockwise direction. It involves transposing the matrix and then reversing the rows.

13. **Check Identity Matrix**: A program to check if a matrix is an identity matrix (diagonal elements are 1, and all other elements are 0).

14. **Boundary Elements Printing**: This program prints only the boundary elements of a 2D array, which means the outermost rows and columns.

15. **Zigzag Traversal**: A program to traverse the 2D array in a zigzag pattern, where rows are traversed alternatively from left to right and right to left.
